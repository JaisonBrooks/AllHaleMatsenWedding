               <h1 class="text-center fancy-text ">Our Story</h1>
               <hr class="style17">
               <h2 class="fancy-text">The Beginning</h2>
               <p class="lead">Our story begins on a moon-lit night on the planet Pandora where two strangers meet for the first time. Soon after introductions are made, the budding couple begins their journey of chaos and wanton destruction, filling the air with the screams of dying Psychos, the ozone from Bandit's laser weapons, and Clap Trap's inane chatter. For the uninitiated, this was the scene for our first date:  Playing "Borderlands 2" on Xbox Live.</p>
               <h2 class="fancy-text">Her Story</h2>
               <p class="lead">I knew he was worth getting to know when the first thing he asked me about was my motorcycle instead of the inane or misogynistic crap most other guys spouted out. Fast forwarding six months, I threw Anthony for a spin telling him I would be leaving for the Marine Corps in eight months. Despite this sudden change, he stuck by me and helped me get as physically fit as possible before I shipped off to boot camp. Even after finding out how much I am not a morning person, he made me meet him at the gym at 0400 every day. It was at this point that I knew that I loved him. To have a man in my life willing to do everything he could to help me strive for career goal that is usually occupied by men is rare. Once I knew I had that caliber of man in my life, there was no way I was going to let him go. I don’t think Anthony realized how much I cared for him until I traded a signing bonus that would have required me to ship off early in exchange for a special weekend with him at cabin in the McCall area.
<br/><br/>
Those wintery days and nights in McCall with the two of us snug in a warm cabin, allowed us to solidify our bond. In fact, one of my fondest memories was of us cuddled up on the couch, my head resting on his lap, while we played Borderlands together next to a roaring fire as the storms drifted snow around us. This memory, and many others, built the connection that would get us through the next three months apart…and even more after that.
<br/><br/>
Those months were challenging as I worked to get through each day of boot camp, but Anthony was a constant source of support. I remember as I was getting ready to ship out, he told me not to expect a letter every day, like my sister-in-law wrote for my brother when he went through Boot. And he was right, I didn't get one letter a day... I got two, sometimes three. Seeing Anthony that week of Boot Leave between Basic and MCT got me through the bitter cold and long-ass rucks of MCT. He made that week full of warm and fuzzies and little moments I would softly smile at to this day. He even handled my sugar addiction that week after being deprived for three months, though it scared him. At this point I knew nothing I did could scare him away, despite I am sure, in his mind the fact I loved him scared him to death. But I was sure our love for each other and willingness to fight through anything together would win out. Now with the hook set, I just needed to wait patiently to draw him in all the way.
<br/><br/>
<em>Each and every day I am amazed at how lucky I am to have such a supportive, wonderfully kind, thoughtful, and seriously sexy man in my life. I look forward to many more years of having you in my life Anthony. I thank you so much for putting up with the long months of being apart so we can always know our hearts are forever entwined.</em>
</p>
              <h2 class="fancy-text">His Story</h2>
              <p class="lead">I'm actually going to take my story back in time, before we met, to better tell my story. Obviously by the description of our first date Jess and I met online. The thing that most people may not be aware of is that I had given up on dating just before we met. Apparently Someone Else had other ideas for me. You see, while I was closing out my account, I came across a profile that intrigued me. Here was a girl who had no pictures that showed her face and very little beyond a vague idea of her body shape, but what she wrote resonated within me and inspired me to give it one last go. So for the next couple weeks we chatted a bit online, and when I finally got the nerve to ask her out.... She shot me down! Here was, as far as I could tell, an intelligent confident woman telling me that as cool as I seemed to be, anyone can put a front on for the internet, so No I could not have her phone number and No I could not pick her up. Well....damn... I guess it was time to get creative! In our conversations, it had come up that we were both gamers and shared a special love for the Borderlands franchise, so the idea of an Xbox Live session was born and thus our first date. So now that we are caught up to the beginning, let’s move forward to the future a bit.<br/><br/>
               Jess and I had lots of fun together doing everything from card and board games with her family to long motorcycle rides, and of course video games, but always I held back a little bit, believing things that were too good had to end, right? Well, then she dropped the bomb. Her dream had always been to serve her country, like her father before her and then her brother, and she was going to join the Marines. I'll be honest: I had no idea how to process that or what it would mean for us as a couple. The one thing I did know, was that I had to help, I had to support her. So the following week I began training her at the gym in the early morning hours and the weeks flew by. Pretty soon it was time for her to ship out to boot camp and we said one of the hardest goodbyes I’ve ever had to say.<br/><br/>
               	At the beginning I had told her not to expect too much from me letter wise, but pretty soon I found myself writing each day and it was here in almost journal-like fashion that I was finally able to say the things I hadn’t been able to say out loud to her, let alone to myself. It was also during this time that I got to know Rita and Scott, Jessica’s parents, really well and develop an awesome friendship with them. The next three months passed quickly and soon it was time for Jessica’s graduation. So I flew back east to meet up with her parents and we began our post boot camp vacation road trip from South Carolina to Universal Studios Florida and then back up to North Carolina. It was a magical time and it was during this trip that I discovered and solidified my belief that I wanted to spend the rest of my life with her. And so, the very next weekend back in Boise, I started looking for rings and trying to figure out how I would survive asking her father’s permission to marry his one and only daughter.<br/><br/>
               	Asking Scott for his blessing to marry his daughter was an adventure in and of itself. Realistically I probably shouldn’t have been that nervous I mean, her mother helped with picking out the ring so I should have known I was going to be good, right? Wrong. Scott was the X Factor in all of this, and I had no idea what he would make me do to gain his blessing, especially since I wasn’t able to fly out to North Carolina to ask in person.  So we arranged to talk one evening on Skype, and I will forever remember how that evening felt. You see, Scott had set it up so that when he answered my call, the back of his computer chair was to the screen and, just like re-enacting a scene from Inspector Gadget with Dr. Claw, he slowly spins around pretending to pet a cat and answers with “Yeeeeesssssss?” I had no idea what to say, I mean I was expecting something… but not that!!  So in a halting fashion I manage to stammer out my request for his blessing in marrying his daughter. He stared at me for a few minutes and then replied: “I see. Well I have a few questions for you.”  From this point he proceeded to ask questions of the strangest sort. For example, one of the questions he asked was: “Paper or Plastic?”  He would then respond to my answers as if they had a hidden implication. This went on for thirty or forty minutes until I was rescued by both his mother and his wife who said something along the lines of: “SCOTT ALLAN HALE! You’ve asked enough questions; we like him so you tell him YES right now!”  That’s right folks, I might have cheated a little bit and got Jessica’s Mom and Oma recruited to my cause, and while fortune may favor the bold, I prefer to be prepared! Eventually Scott did give me his blessing and the planning for a proposal began.</p>

                 <p class="lead">Having secured THE RING and, after much trial, her father’s blessing, it was now time to figure out how to make this proposal happen.  I knew that I wanted to do something unique and special that would pay homage to our first date on Borderlands.  Eventually, the idea of having a custom ring box made representing one of the rare Loot Crate’s found in the Borderlands games occurred to me. Much internet searching eventually led me to Paul Pape of Paul Pape Designs. Paul is a wizard at designing and building custom geek ring boxes, and he masterfully brought my idea to life.</p>
               </div>
               <p class="lead">
Having figured out the presentation part of my proposal, it was now time to orchestrate when we could get together. Lucky for us, Jessica had some time between MCT school and the start of her next set of classes, so we were able to arrange a Santa Cruz vacation in April of 2015. 
It’s important to note at this junction that Jessica and I had primarily only been able to communicate via letter from October 2014 to January 2015, when she graduated from Boot Camp, and then via text message, occasional calls and Skype until we were able to meet in April. So obviously to anyone who knows me, there might have been some “slight” overthinking on my part. Let’s just say that Rachel’s and Jessica’s parents’ love and support were amazing during this time period.<br/><br/>
Keeping with our itinerary, we wandered several beaches, explored the Santa Cruz boardwalk, and enjoyed each other’s company. But I was so nervous and distracted that I found it hard to be fully present for the first half of our vacation. Being with Jessica validated all the emotions and desires I’d been harboring, but my internal dialogue inserted itself loudly enough that I’m fairly sure I drove her a little crazy. She took it all in stride…Mostly.<br/><br/>
As our vacation was winding down, my opportunities to propose were dwindling. On April 20th I’m fairly certain Jessica decided to take matters into her own hands and set up the perfect place. Her methodology I suspect was to suggest touring the famous 17-mile drive outside of Monterey that goes from Pacific Grove to Pebble Beach. But the timing still was never quite right and she almost unknowingly forced my hand when she grabbed my camera bag to capture some beautiful photos of the ocean. She didn’t know that I had hidden her ring inside, and I almost snatched her arm off keeping the secret secure.<br/><br/>
After the 17-mile drive, we decided to go spend some time on the beautiful pristine white sandy beaches of Carmel-by-the-Sea. It was here, sitting on the sun warmed sand, watching the waves crash against the beach and with the wind kissing our lips, that I proposed; but I don’t think it really went the way either of us expected. In fact, Jessica almost gave me a heart attack.<br/><br/>
</p>
<div class="clearfix">
  <p class="lead">We had been sitting on the beach for a while, watching a storm play across the white capped waves off in the distance, when I reached into my camera bag and told Jessica I had had something special made for her. Pulling out her bubble-wrapped box I handed it over to her and said “I hope you like it.” Amidst the wind, I anxiously watched her unwrap it and let out a gasp of surprise as she discovers a miniature replica of a Loot Crate.</p>
  <a class="fancybox" rel="group" href="images/Ring_Box.jpg"><img src="images/Ring_Box.jpg" height="190" alt="..." class="img-rounded pull-right" style="margin-left: 16px; margin-top: 20px;"></a>
 <p class="lead">For an endless minute or two, she spun the box around in her hands making little exclamations and saying how cool it was. Finally, I couldn’t wait any longer and had to intervene. I mean seriously, who is handed a box and doesn’t open it?!!!  So, casually I told her she should open it and see how cool the inside is. So she opened it and went perfectly still and stared at the ring nestled inside.  Suddenly there wasn’t enough air in the world for me to breathe let alone get words out and time stopped for an eon. Finally, I manage to stutter out something along the lines of “Jessica, will you marry me?”  As the word “Yes” softly left her lips, the world snapped into focus and we kissed. 
<br/><br/>We spent the rest of our vacation happily alternating between sharing our news with friends and family and celebrating the future we were embarking upon. </p>

               <p class="lead">This will be a two-part event with the Ceremony occurring at the Multnomah Falls Lodge and the Reception happening in the heart of Portland. Our wedding theme is Steampunk featuring Neo-Victorian attire. As this is occurring on Halloween, we encourage everyone to dress in costumes if they wish, though costumes are not required to match our theme, we do ask that they be tasteful and appropriate for a family enviorment.  Below you will find details for the individual events.</p>
               <h2 class="fancy-text">Wedding</h2>
               <p class="lead">The wedding ceremony will be held against the back drop of the majestic Multnomah Falls. The falls, and the lodge nearby, hold a special place in the heart of the Hale family, being the location of many a family trip. Jessica in particular fell in love with the beauty of the falls at a young age and has dreamed often of being wed there.</p>

                <p class="lead">The reception will start at 7pm at Henry's 12th street Tavern, located in the heart of the Pearl District of Portland. Henry's Tavern is an iconic location that occupies what was once the Blitz-Weinhard Brew House, which brewed beer on site for more than 140 years. Henry’s has an incredibly rich history, inviting atmosphere and wonderful food. Speaking of food, we will have a selection of different foods catered by Henry’s, please make sure you let us know in the RSVP form if there are any special dietary concerns.</p>

               <p class="lead">It is our hope that by giving everyone several months’ notice, more will be able to attend. However, we are aware that since this is occurring on a Monday, this may restrict some from joining us in person. We understand and in the event that you are unable to attend, please celebrate wherever you are!<br/><br/>
As indicated above, this is a two-part event with the ceremony held at Multnomah Falls and the reception in downtown Portland. Unfortunately, the size of the venue at Multnomah limits the number of people we can have in attendance for the actual ceremony. Because of this limitation, we are specifically requesting people RSVP for the reception. As we get closer to the wedding date, and are able to solidify our numbers for attendance, we will be reaching out with regard to the ceremony itself. If you would prefer to only attend the reception, please indicate this in the “note” section of the RSVP.  We look forward to celebrating with everyone!

Wedding Theme: Steampunk
Wedding Party Attire: Neo-Victorian
